# GoTTV
fork of [GIFT](https://github.com/issork/gift)  
This is a version of [GIFT](https://github.com/issork/gift) I made with some quality of life features  
## Controls  
type words in textbox and press enter = send message  
type streamer name in textbox and press tab = change channel  
  #
note1: if the chat client crashes then it is likely that someone has a cheer (bits) badge that starts with 1. to combat this I recommend disabling badges after a crash.  
note2: if you try doing mod commands in the client I recommend enabling mod mode.   
note3: you need a twitch client id and secret and you can get them both [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
